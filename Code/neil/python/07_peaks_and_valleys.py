Peaks and Valleys

Define the following functions:

peaks(data) - Returns the indices of peaks. A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.

valleys(data) - Returns the indices of 'valleys'. A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.

peaks_and_valleys(data) - uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys in order of appearance in the original data.

Version 2 (optional)

Using the data list above, draw the image of X's above.

Hint 1: If you wanted to draw this horizontally, you could do so very easily like this.

for num in data:
    print('x' * num)
Hint 2: print can only work on one line at a time, so you'll have to loop and decide to either print a space ' ' or an 'X' for every column.

Version 3 (optional)

Imagine pouring water into onto these hills. The water would wash off the left and right sides, but would accumulate in the valleys. Below the water is represented by O's. Given data, calculate the amount of water that would be collected, and if you can, draw the following diagram.

                                                  X  O  O  O  O  O  X
