    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by artist
        Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30,
        1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
        philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. </p>

    <p>Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
        Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin, allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and
        Catwoman, and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker. Batman's origin
        story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and
        Martha; he trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham
        streets at night.</p>

    <p>Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently
        claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something
        more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally
        introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with
        a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any
        superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series
        used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended.
        Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the
        1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.</p>

    <p>DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and
        Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United
        States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a
        member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other
        characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the
        1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc and Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011. DC has also published
        comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its
        successors, the Flashpoint incarnation, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories.</p>

    <p>One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book
        superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes,
        and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this
        includes toy lines such as Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted
        in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series played by Adam West and
        in films by Michael Keaton in <a href="https://youtu.be/GIiyHPZ8H98" target="_blank"> Batman (1989) </a> and
        Batman Returns
        (1992), Christian Bale in The Dark Knight Trilogy
        (2005–2012), Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe (2016–present) and Robert Pattinson in The Batman (2022).
        Kevin Conroy, Jason O'Mara, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the character's voice.</p>
